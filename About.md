### Hi there! :wave:

My name is Martin and I am the author of NGRAMS.

I am a backend developer and like to build software that deals with large amounts of data. I do things in C++ because it's fast — at least at runtime, not necessarily at development time. I also like web programming to some extent thanks to TypeScript. When I should name my most important software development principle it would be [Keep It Simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). I received a master's degree in computer science in 2012 from the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar (Germany).

NGRAMS is my third implementation of a search engine of this kind.
